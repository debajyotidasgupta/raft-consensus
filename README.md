<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## Project Details

Add the details of the project here. Mainly add the following
- [ ] Description of each file and their functioning
- [ ] If the code is divided in classes or as per use case, mention the working of the class
- [ ] Mention the important variables and describe them
- [ ] If possible add a short theory to support your descriptions

### raft/server.go
*This file contains all the necessary code for implementing servers in a network using TCP
along with various Remote Procedural Calls*

#### Server struct
Structure to define a service object
#### Server methods
*CreateServer\:* create a Server Instance with serverId and list of peerIds  
*ConnectionAccept\:* keep listening for incoming connections and serve them  
*Serve\:* start a new service  
*Stop\:* stop an existing service  
*ConnectToPeer\:* connect to another server or peer  
*DisconnectPeer\:* disconnect from a particular peer  
*RPC\:* make an RPC call to the particular peer  
*RequestVote\:* RPC call from a raft node for RequestVote  
*AppendEntries\:* RPC call from a raft node for AppendEntries  

### raft/simulator.go
*This file contains all the necessary code to setup a cluster of raft nodes, interact with the 
cluster and execute different commands such as read, write and config change on the cluster.*

#### ClusterSimulator struct
Structure to define a Raft cluster
#### Simulator methods
*CreateNewCluster\:* create a new Raft cluster consisting of a given number of nodes and establish
connections between them  
*Shutdown\:* shut down all servers in the cluster  
*CollectCommits\:* reads channel and adds all received entries to the corresponding commits  
*DisconnectPeer\:* disconnect a server from other servers  
*ReconnectPeer\:* reconnect a disconnected server to other servers  
*CrashPeer\:* crash a server and shut it down  
*RestartPeer\:* restart a crashed server and reconnect to other peers  
*SubmitToServer\:* submit a command to a server  
*Check_Functions\:* auxiliary helper functions to check the status of the raft cluster: CheckUniqueLeader,
CheckNoLeader and CheckCommitted  

### raft/raft_test.go
*This file has a set of test functions designed to test the various functionalities of the raft protocol.
The tests can be designed into 3 major classes:*  
*Tests to check Leader Election*  
*Tests to check Command Commits*  
*Tests to check Membership Changes*

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- [ ] Tell about installing clean `GO`
To run the code in this Assignment, one needs to have Go installed in their system. If it is not
already installed, it can be done by following the steps in [https://www.tecmint.com/install-go-in-ubuntu/#:~:text=To%20download%20the%20latest%20version,download%20it%20on%20the%20terminal.&text=Next%2C%20extract%20the%20tarball%20to%20%2Fusr%2Flocal%20directory.&text=Add%20the%20go%20binary%20path,a%20system%2Dwide%20installation).](Install Go Ubuntu)
  

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
