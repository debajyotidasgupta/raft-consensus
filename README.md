<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/overall.png)

This project demonstrates the implementation of the `Raft Consensus algorithm` which is a consensus bases protocol for distributed systems. This project is built as a part of the course `CS60002` **_Distributed Systems_** at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. This project implements a simple version of the raft protocol, which can be used as a base template to build your own distributed system by adding features. Following are the core features implemented in this projects:

- Raft Consensus RPCs
  - `RequestVote` RPC
  - `AppendEntries` RPC
- Raft Log
  - `Log` class
- Raft State Machine
  - `StateMachine` (a simple state machine)
- Raft Leader Election
  - `LeaderElection` RPC
- Raft Consensus
  - `RaftConsensus` class
- `Membership Change` Feature
- Visualization with `timing diagram`
- Single `client interface` for testing the features

A single client interface was built mainly because this is a simple working protoype and not industrial-strength distributed system. The client interface is a simple command line interface which can be used to test the features of the project. All the RPCs are implemented in accordance with [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout. This implementation of the raft can be used as a base model and can be extended to build your own distributed system by adding advanced features and implementing multiple client gateway.

  - `Server struct` - Structure to define a service object
  - `Server` methods - Methods to implement the server
    - **_CreateServer\:_** create a Server Instance with serverId and list of peerIds
    - **_ConnectionAccept\:_** keep listening for incoming connections and serve them
    - **_Serve\:_** start a new service
    - **_Stop\:_** stop an existing service
    - **_ConnectToPeer\:_** connect to another server or peer
    - **_DisconnectPeer\:_** disconnect from a particular peer
    - **_RPC\:_** make an RPC call to the particular peer
    - **_RequestVote\:_** RPC call from a raft node for RequestVote
    - **_AppendEntries\:_** RPC call from a raft node for AppendEntries
- **raft/simulator.go** - _This file contains all the necessary code to setup a cluster of raft nodes, interact with the cluster and execute different commands such as read, write and config change on the cluster._
  - `ClusterSimulator` struct - Structure to define a Raft cluster
  - `Simulator` methods - Methods to implement the cluster
    - **_CreateNewCluster\:_** create a new Raft cluster consisting of a given number of nodes and establish
    - connections between them
    - **_Shutdown\:_** shut down all servers in the cluster
    - **_CollectCommits\:_** reads channel and adds all received entries to the corresponding commits
    - **_DisconnectPeer\:_** disconnect a server from other servers
    - **_ReconnectPeer\:_** reconnect a disconnected server to other servers
    - **_CrashPeer\:_** crash a server and shut it down
    - **_RestartPeer\:_** restart a crashed server and reconnect to other peers
    - **_SubmitToServer\:_** submit a command to a server
    - **_Check_Functions\:_** auxiliary helper functions to check the status of the raft cluster: CheckUniqueLeader, CheckNoLeader and CheckCommitted
- **raft/raft_test.go** - _This file has a set of test functions designed to test the various functionalities of the raft protocol. The tests can be designed into 3 major classes:_
  - **_Tests to check Leader Election_**
  - **_Tests to check Command Commits_**
  - **_Tests to check Membership Changes_**
- **raft/config.go** - _This file has a custom implementation of a Set Data Structure as it is not provided inherently by Go. This implementation is inspired by [Set in Golang](https://golangbyexample.com/set-implementation-in-golang/). It provides the following functions:_
  - **_makeSet_**
  - **_Exists_**
  - **_Add_**
  - **_Remove_**
  - **_Size_**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Go**  
  To run the code in this Assignment, one needs to have Go installed in their system. If it is not
  already installed, it can be done by following the steps in [Install Go Ubuntu](https://www.tecmint.com/install-go-in-ubuntu/#:~:text=To%20download%20the%20latest%20version,download%20it%20on%20the%20terminal.&text=Next%2C%20extract%20the%20tarball%20to%20%2Fusr%2Flocal%20directory.&text=Add%20the%20go%20binary%20path,a%20system%2Dwide%20installation)

### Installation

_In order to setup a local copy of the project, you can follow the one of the 2 methods listed below. Once the local copy is setup, the steps listed in [User interaction with the system](#usage) can be used to interact with the system._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/debajyotidasgupta/raft-consensus
   ```
2. Unzip the attached submission to unpack all the files included with the project.  

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Setting DEBUG level
_In order to obtain logs regarding the execution of Raft algorithm you need to set DEBUG variable as 1 inside raft/raft.go_  
_Similarly if you do not wish to see huge logs and just see the outputs of execution you can set the DEBUG level to 0_

- [ ] Include details about git clone and running after unzipping submission
- [ ] Installing dependencies
- [ ] Set `DEBUG` and any other **_SECRET KEY_**

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

- [ ] Write about main.go

### User interaction with the system

_To interact with the system from the console, do the following steps\:_

1.  Open terminal from the main project directory
2.  Run the main go file
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
3.  You will be presented with a menu with necessary commands to create raft cluster, send commands, etc.

### Running tests 

_A comprehensive set of tests has been provided in **raft/raft_test.go**. In order to run these tests, do the following steps\:_

1.  To run a particular test execute the following command from the main project directory
    ```sh
    go test -timeout 30s -v -run ^[Test Name]$ raft-consensus/raft
    ```
2.  To run the entire test suite run the following command from the main project directory
    ```sh
    go test -v raft-consensus/raft
    ```
